Notes
-----
This used to be part of the main DBM download but was separated do to frequent request that pvp mods were sort of "forced" in DBM-Core previously and could not be disabled without manual deletion. Now this package is an extra that allows users more control and keeps DBM-Core strictly to the main raid content.
